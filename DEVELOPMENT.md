# DEVELOPMENT.md — Daily-Loop Cheatsheet

The dev environment is a lightweight Docker "dev sandbox" (no VS Code Dev
Containers). The workspace is a single shared source of truth: a bind-mount
between the host and the `dev` container — you, the AI coding agent, and the
running app all see the same files. This cheatsheet covers the daily loop. Full
architecture and conventions live in `AGENTS.md` / `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

## Golden rules

1. `make dev-up` to start → `make dev-log` (2nd terminal) → `make dev-down` when done
2. `make check` before every push — always green before PR
3. Only `dev-up` requires opencode; `infra-up` + host loop (`make check`) don't

> Rule 3 in practice: the **sandbox-starting** targets run the preflight and
> need the host opencode binary — `dev-up`, `dev-restart`, `opencode`,
> `sandbox`. Everything else (including `make check`) never does.

## Architecture at a glance

```
You (host editor)  ──edit──▶  workspace (bind mount)
                                   │  hot reload (uvicorn --reload + vite HMR)
                                   ▼
docker compose up dev  ──▶  dev (uvicorn :8000 + vite :5173)
                           worker (arq document processor)
                           postgres (:5432) · redis (:6379) · minio (:9000)
```

opencode (the AI coding agent) can run **on the host** or **inside the `dev`
container** (`make opencode`). Both see the same files.

## Start / stop

```bash
make dev-up        # START: build (once) + dev + worker + postgres + redis + minio
                   # foreground with combined logs — Ctrl+C stops it
make dev-log       # tail the dev sandbox logs (uvicorn + vite; worker: compose logs -f worker)
make dev-down      # STOP: tear down the stack (postgres data volume kept)
make dev-restart   # RESTART: down + up in one step, no rebuild, data still there
make infra-up      # infra only (postgres/redis/minio) for the host-native loop
make infra-down    # stop infra only

docker compose down -v    # ONLY to wipe the database + Redis + MinIO too
```

- Host ports: frontend `:5175`, backend API `:8001` (docs at `/docs`), postgres
  `:5434`, redis `:63790`, MinIO console `:9001`. Inside the `dev` container the
  stack is reachable at `:8000` / `:5173`.
- `make dev-up` requires the opencode binary (`${HOME}/.opencode/bin/opencode`);
  install with `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`. It pre-creates
  `~/.config/opencode` and `~/.gitconfig` (mounted read-only into the container).

## Code with AI — sandboxed (recommended)

```bash
make opencode         # → the AI coding agent TUI inside the dev container
                      #   (runs `opencode --auto`: permission prompts are
                      #   auto-approved — the sandbox is trusted by design)
```

`--auto` is the default; override per-invocation:

```bash
make opencode OPENCODE_ARGS=""                          # bare TUI (prompts back)
make opencode OPENCODE_ARGS="--auto -m provider/model"  # pick a model
make opencode OPENCODE_ARGS="run 'task' --auto"         # one-shot non-interactive
```

Or open a plain shell first, then start the agent yourself:

```bash
make sandbox          # interactive bash inside the dev container
cd /workspace && opencode
```

One-shot mode without a shell (TTY-aware — interactive commands keep a TTY,
piped stdin uses `-T`):

```bash
scripts/open-in-sandbox.sh 'uv run pytest'
```

Inside the sandbox the agent has node 22, uv (+ baked `/opt/backend-venv`), gh
(host creds), your opencode config, git identity, `make`, and the Docker CLI
(compose plugin included) — plus the running stack at `:8000` / `:5173`, so
`make check` and end-to-end curls work without leaving the container.

> Trusted-agent model: the dev container shares the workspace bind-mount, the
> host Docker socket, gh auth, and opencode config with the host by design.
> Isolation covers the agent's runtime, not Docker/workspace access — the same
> trust granted to opencode on the host. The `worker` service receives none of
> these mounts.

## Code with AI — on the host (fallback)

```bash
make infra-up             # infra services only (detached)
cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # backend on :8000
cd frontend && npm run dev                           # vite on :5173
make check                # lint + tests + build (no containers needed)
```

## Tests / lint / build (host-native — no sandbox required)

```bash
make check        # = lint (ruff + oxlint) + tests (pytest + vitest) + build
make test         # test-backend (pytest) + test-frontend (vitest)
make lint         # ruff + oxlint
make build        # frontend typecheck + production build
```

- Backend tests need `postgres`/`redis`/`minio` up (`make infra-up`).
- Known pre-existing failure: `test_metrics_endpoint_exposes_process_and_http_metrics`
  (worker heartbeat invisible to the test Redis DB — 231/232 pass). Unrelated to
  app code; tracked as a separate fix.
- After heavy in-container builds (`make opencode` + builds), files the
  container wrote as root inside `/workspace` (e.g. `frontend/dist`,
  `node_modules/.vite`, `__pycache__`) may need `sudo chown -R $(whoami) .` on
  the host before re-building there. They are all gitignored, so git is never
  affected.

## Tools

```bash
make setup        # host deps: uv sync + npm install (first clone)
make host-tools   # mise install — kind/kubectl/helm/kustomize/devspace (host)
```

## Migrations

- Sandbox: `alembic upgrade head` runs automatically on `make dev-up`.
- Host-native: `cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head`.
- New migrations: `cd backend && uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."`.
